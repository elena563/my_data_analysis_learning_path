# My Data Analysis Learning Path

This repository collects some of my first data analysis exercises, in order to deepen my understanding of pandas, numpy and other data analysis techniques.
The main goal is, after years of a total theorical study, to improve practical skills in data analysis.

### Content

Every exercise is a small exploratory analysis on some dataset, conceived independently or assigned during university courses.
Every folder contains one (or more) dataset and a notebook, if part of group work, entirely redone by me.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- and other Python libraries for data analytics
